There are two main scoreboards used for game operation: vars and used.
Vars stores variables for all sorts of things.
Used stores whether or not a word has been used.

In addition, there are several other scoreboard objectives:
deaths: stores deaths per player.
book_count: stores how many books the player has.
gotten_book: stores whether the player has gotten a book yet.
dropped_book: stores whether the player dropped their book or not.
